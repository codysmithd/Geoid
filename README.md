# Geoid
Open-source Graphical GPS debugger for OS X

*Not yet ready for use*

Geoid plans to process:
- Text data from GPS module
- Serial (UART) data from GPS modules

This data is then displayed on a GUI for the purpose of debugging, showing:
- Time in UTC
- Latitude
- Latitude direction (North or South)
- Longitude
- Longitude direction (East or West)
- Fix quality
- Number of satellites being tracked
- Horizontal dilution of position
- Altitude, Meters, above mean sea level
- Height of geoid (mean sea level) above WGS84 ellipsoid
- Time in seconds since last DGPS update
- DGPS station ID number
